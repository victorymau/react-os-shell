## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-28

Initial public packaging. The shell has been running in production inside a small ERP for some time; this is the first standalone release.

### Added

- **Shell**: `<Layout>`, `<StartMenu>`, `<Desktop>` (with sticky notes + folders), `<WindowManager>`, `<Modal>` (standard / compact / widget styles), `<PopupMenu>`, `<ConfirmDialog>`, `<GlobalSearch>` (Cmd-K), `<ShortcutHelp>`, `<NotificationBell>`, `<BugReportDetail>`, `<StatusBadge>`, frosted-glass theming, `<GoogleConnectModal>`.
- **Bundled apps (12 in `bundledApps`)**: Calculator, Spreadsheet, Weather, CurrencyConverter, PomodoroTimer, Chess, Checkers, Sudoku, Tetris, Game2048, Email, GeminiChat. Four more (Calendar, Notepad, WorldClock, Minesweeper) ship in the package but are not yet in `bundledApps` because they require consumer-supplied prefs / leaderboard wiring.
- **Hooks**: `useWindowManager`, `useTheme`, full hotkey/nav system (`useNewHotkey`, `useEditHotkey`, `useModalNav`, `useModalSave`, `useModalDuplicate`, `useTableNav`, `useMultiModal`), `useGoogleAuth`, `useEmailUnread`, `useClickOutside`.
- **Consumer-config surfaces**: `<ShellAuthProvider>`, `<ShellPrefsProvider>`, `<ShellEntityFetcherProvider>`, `<BugReportConfigProvider>`, `<DesktopHostProvider>`, `<StatusBadgeProvider>`. Plus module-level setters used at app-startup: `setShellApiClient`, `setShellAuthBridge`, `setShellWindowRegistry`.
- **Window-registry composer**: `createWindowRegistry(...partials)` lets consumers merge the package's `bundledApps` with their own entity-window definitions.
- **Toast system**: `toast.success / .error / .info` with auto-mounted container.
- **Themes**: light, dark (frosted-glass tinting baked into `styles.css`).

### Notes

- TypeScript declarations ship for the full public surface (`dist/index.d.ts` ~22 KB).
- Built with **tsup**, ESM-only output. React, react-dom, react-router-dom, @tanstack/react-query, react-hook-form, tailwindcss, @headlessui/react, @heroicons/react are peer dependencies.
- The 16 apps ship as `lazy()` components; consumers don't pay code-size cost for apps they don't open.
